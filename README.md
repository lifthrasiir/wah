# WebAssembly interpreter in a Header (WAH)

This is **WAH**, a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) interpreter implemented in a single C header file. It aims to provide the compact, portable and comprehensive support for WebAssembly 3.0, especially its [deterministic profile](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/profiles.html#deterministic-profile-small-mathrm-det).

WAH is a Public Domain ([equivalent](./LICENSE.txt)) software. The vast majority of its code has been generated by [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/), albeit with substantial human guidance and fixes, making it a copyrightable work.
